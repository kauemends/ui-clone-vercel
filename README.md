# Inspiration

 I did this project based on a video from the [Rocketseat](https://www.youtube.com/rocketseat) channel and the site of [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

# Experience

But I made some changes, like adding the border and blur effect to the header when scrolling down the mouse.

I had never used Sass before, and I really liked it. I will probably want to go deeper.

# Techs

In this project, I used HTML, JavaScript and Sass.
